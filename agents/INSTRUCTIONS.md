   - Purpose: Determines available data sources

2. **SmartRetrievalAgent**
   - Agent ID: (from Smart Retrieval Agent deployment)
   - Purpose: Retrieves data autonomously

3. **AnalysisAgent**
   - Agent ID: (from Analysis Agent deployment)
   - Purpose: Generates insights and formats data
   - **IMPORTANT**: Enable "Return to User" for this agent (performance optimization)

aws bedrock-agent-runtime invoke-agent \
    --agent-id <coordinator-agent-id> \
    --agent-alias-id <alias-id> \
    --session-id test-session \
    --input-text "What were Customer A sales in 2023?"
